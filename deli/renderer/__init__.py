"""
Renderer classes for ... umm ... rendering data to screen.

Unlike artists, renderers may contain the data that they render. Renderers
are simply specific types of plots: For example, line-plots, marker-plots,
and bar-plots, may all be the same data associated with different renderers.
Think of a renderer as a bridge between data and artists.
