Plots classes for rendering data to screen.

Unlike artists, plots may contain the data that they render. Think of a plot as
a bridge between data and artists. For example, line plots, marker plots, and
bar plots, may all be the same data associated with different plots. Note that
plots may not map directly to artists: A scatter plot uses a marker artist, but
a line plot might consist of *both* line and marker artists.
