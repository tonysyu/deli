"""
Plots classes for rendering data to screen.

Unlike styluses, plots may contain the data that they render. Think of a plot as
a bridge between data and styluses. For example, line plots, marker plots, and
bar plots, may all be the same data associated with different plots. Note that
plots may not map directly to styluses: A scatter plot uses a marker stylus, but
a line plot might consist of *both* line and marker styluses.
